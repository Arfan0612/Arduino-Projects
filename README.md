# Introduction
This repository includes my Arduino project from my undergraduate degree in EE from Year 1 and during my mentorship for high school students during summer of 2022.

# Robot_Car
Simple algorithm used to interface a sound sensor with the Arduino board. It works by pressing a push button to make the sensor listens to "claps" and response accordingly to the number of "claps" detected.

# ultrasonic_sensor_concept
Simple arduino code including utilization of ultrasonic sensor with Arduino Robot Car for obstacle avoidance. 

# line_following_concept
A simple line following algorithm using DIY IR sensor.

# remote_control_bluetooth
Uses bluetooth communication between your phone and a bluetooth module connected to the Arduino to control the car.
